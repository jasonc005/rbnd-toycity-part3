I probably spent about 3-4 hours working on this project. I'd say the most rewarding
challenge I conquered was figuring out how to check for an existing instance of
Customer and Product objects to throw an error. This furthered my understanding of
arrays and the methods they have to make them more useful, something I hope to be
able to use in future products. The two additional features I built were class
methods for Transaction; one to allow for finding all transactions by associated
customer and one for finding by product. I feel that these could both be very useful
for tracking customer habits or how well products are selling. I think I can still
grow in the area of further exploring array methods to improve the ways in which I
use them, and possibly get ideas for interesting ways to implement them in future
program features.
